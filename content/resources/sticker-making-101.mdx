In 2024, I created a presentation teaching people the basics of how make
stickers at home using a printer, a Cricut, and sticker paper. This
presentation was designed to accompany a class where I taught my coworkers.

On this page, I've shared the slide deck from this presentation to help
others who might be interested in exploring the art of sticker making! I've
found a lot of joy in making stickers at home and sharing them with my friends,
so in sharing this resource, I hope that I can help others find fun in making
stickers at home.
