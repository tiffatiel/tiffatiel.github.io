## Game description

Pass the Panel is a game where players take turns drawing the panels in a
comic! Itâ€™s a fun game that you can play with any drawing supplies!

**2+ players**
**At least one piece of paper per player**
**At least one pen or pencil per player**

**To play:** Give each player a piece of paper and something to draw with.
The first turn, each player draws a 4 panel comic grid on their paper, then
draws the first panel of the comic.

After all players are done drawing their panel, each player passes their comic
to the player to their right. Then, everyone draws the next panel! Repeat
until all panels are drawn.

Once the comics are done, share them, so you can all see how your stories turned out!

## Notes

I did not invent Pass the Panel, but I did come up with the "Pass the Panel"
name to try to describe this game. I first played this game in an art club in
college, but I have not been able to find references to this game online,
so I wanted to document its rules for other artists to play.

I often play Pass the Panel with my friends. I've also hosted workshops
based on this game, including as [part of Sour Cherry Con](https://www.sourcherrycomics.com/2024/05/08/sour-cherry-con-2024-recap/)!

I always have tons of fun when I play this game and have found it a good
exercise for helping me let go and find the joy in drawing comics. I hope that
in sharing this writeup, I can help others experience these same benefits!
